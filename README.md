Created a blog website with the ability for anyone to update or delte articles.

We used node js and Express to build a full-stack app we npm packages like pg-promise muastach-express and body-parser. This helped us bring data to our postgress Database and also fetch data that we sent in. We used id's to pull exsisting articles in the database to update and delete them. The id's were created when a new article was made on our website.
